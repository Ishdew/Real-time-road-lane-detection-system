# Real Time Road Lane Detection System
## Project overview
* Autonomous Driving Car is one of the most disruptive innovations in AI. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car can go and does everything that an experienced human driver does. But itâ€™s very essential to train it properly. One of the many steps involved during the training of an autonomous driving car is lane detection, which is the preliminary step.

* The primary goal of this project is to develop a Road Lane Detection System that accurately identifies and tracks road lanes in real-time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This system is intended to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Steps Involved
* Input image
* Create the camera caliberation matrix and distortion coefficient and undistort the image
* Applying perspective transform
* Thresholding to extract the lane lines
* Histogram peak detection
* Applying sliding window search algorithm ot detect lane lines
* Apply curve fitting
* Overlay the detected lane lines and output the image
